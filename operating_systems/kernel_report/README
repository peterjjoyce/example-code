This directory contains a simple program to produce a trivial kernel report.

The program kernelReport is designed to run from a linux terminal; i.e., it
will not work if you do not do so.  The program does not install, but rather
simply runs when the terminal session is open and prints the report to the
screen.  The information produced in the report is as of yet utterly basic and
will continue to be improved upon so that it might be more than a simple
assignment and act as something useful to assist users with an alternative to
typing in innumerable commands for a single collection of sought after data.

The program can be compiled using the make command as long as you have the GNU
C compiler installed (gcc). If you run into issues try mannually compiling with
the following commands:
   $  gcc -c -o fileReader.o fileReader.c -I.
	$	gcc -c -o kernelReport.o kernelReport.c -I.
	$	gcc -c -o main.o main.c -I.
	$	gcc -o kernelReport fileReader.o kernelReport.o main.o -I.

Both methods of compilation produce the program kernelReport, which can be run
using the following command:
	$	./kernelReport
